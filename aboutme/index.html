    <p>I am 21 years old and live in the most southern part of the world with my family. There are 5 of us. It can be very cold down here in Tierra del Fuego, Argentina. I love playing the guitar, singing and learning languages. As I was 16 years old, I had the blessing to be an ex-change student in Germany. I lived in that amazing country for one year and was able to learn not only the german language but their culture.</p>
    <p>I have served a full time mission in Chile and in Buenos Aires due to the pandemic. It was no easy but I know that was the best decition I have ever made. I currently work as an English teacher at 2 high schools while I study. I truly believe that learning how to code will open many doors in the future. </p>
    <p>Finally, I was raised up in the church and one of my favorite quotes is <strong>"Education is the difference between wishing you could help other people and being able to help them"</strong> from our prophet. </p>
